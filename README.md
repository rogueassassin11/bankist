Complete JavaScript Course Project 4 - Bankist

This is a course project I coded alongside the Udemy course "The Complete JavaScript Course 2020: From Zero to Expert" by Jonas Schmedtmann. It is a fictional minimalist bank application made on HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. Upon logging in, fictional account movements will be shown and the user can transfer money, request a loan, or close an account.
